# Overview

This repo hosts a collection of scripts for ACI as Code
(https://netascode.cisco.com). These scripts are designed for a single
multi-fabric repo, where fabric configurations are under `./fabrics/<fabric>`;
however, they could be adapted for other file layouts.

# Scripts

`gen_imports.py`

`render_aci_fabrics.py`

`review.py`
